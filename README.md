# General information
This project consists of libraries and also the code for new the nanofluidMixtureSolver solver developed for OpenFOAM v2006. This project focuses on a numerical method implemented in open-source FVM-based OpenFOAM toolbox that accounts for how mass transfer during boiling that affects concentration of nanoparticles. Additionally, concentration dependent viscosity, density, specific heat capacity, and surface tension are implemented based on experimental correlations from literature. The models developed are described in brief below and references for the original papers are also listed. To run the tutorial case(s), please follow the installation guide given.
